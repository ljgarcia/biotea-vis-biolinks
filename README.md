# biotea-vis-biolinks
Small application that showcases the use of the Biotea vis/io 
components using the TREC collection.

This is a proof of concept so it includes npm packages under 
development and not published, i.e., it relies on local dependencies 
that should be downloaded and and install as node_modules of this project for it 
to work. Such dependencies are:
